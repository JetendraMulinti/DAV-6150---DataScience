### NBA Game Outcome Prediction Project Overview

This project aims to harness machine learning techniques to predict outcomes of NBA games with a high degree of accuracy. By analyzing historical data, we identify key factors that influence game results, allowing for informed predictions that can benefit teams, coaches, analysts, and sports enthusiasts. This documentation outlines the complete project flow, detailing each step from data acquisition to model deployment.

#### Project Flow

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - **Data Source**: Our primary data source is the Basketball Reference website, renowned for its comprehensive statistics on NBA games.
   - **Scraping**: We use Python and Selenium, automated in the `BasketBall-Reference_Scraping.ipynb` notebook, to scrape historical game data spanning several seasons. This includes player performance metrics, team statistics, and game outcomes.

2. **Data Preparation**
   - **Cleaning**: Raw data is cleaned to remove inconsistencies, handle missing values, and format data correctly. This step ensures the quality and reliability of our data for analysis.
   - **Feature Engineering**: New features are derived from existing data to enhance model predictions, such as lagged features that capture performance trends over time.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Analysis**: Conducted in the `JetendraMulinti_FinalProject.ipynb` notebook, EDA involves statistical analysis to uncover underlying patterns, test hypotheses, and identify relationships between variables.
   - **Visualization**: Various plots and charts (e.g., correlation matrices and histograms) are generated to visualize data distributions and relationships, aiding in understanding the dataâ€™s structure and informing feature selection.

4. **Feature Selection**
   - **Techniques Employed**: We use statistical tests and machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest) to identify the most predictive features. SHAP values are particularly utilized to understand the impact of each feature on the prediction outcomes.
   - **Optimization**: Features that significantly contribute to model accuracy are retained, while redundant or less impactful ones are discarded to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Building and Training**
   - **Algorithms Used**: We experiment with several models, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost, each chosen for their specific strengths in handling classification tasks.
   - **Training**: Models are trained on the processed dataset, with careful monitoring to balance bias and variance, ensuring they generalize well to new, unseen data.

6. **Model Optimization and Validation**
   - **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization are applied to prevent overfitting, especially observed in initial tests where models performed exceedingly well on training data but poorly on validation data.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Employed to assess model robustness across different data subsets, ensuring the models are stable and reliable.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate each model's performance. Learning curves are plotted to visualize learning progress and performance stability.
   - **Selection**: The best-performing model is selected based on a combination of evaluation metrics and business relevance.

**Jupyter Notebooks Overview**
1. BasketBall-Reference_Scraping.ipynb
